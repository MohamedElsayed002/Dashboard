in order to run the project <br/>

server side <br/>
npm install && npm run dev <br/>

client side <br/>
cd Application && npm run dev 
 
 
some features I'm gonna add like reset password & confirm email and after that I'm gonna go to make next project :) <br/>
I don't have any other idea right now to add in the project
